# Test

Test is an integration test target for [fsm](https://github.com/fsm/fsm).

# Getting Started

From a high level, this library provides you the ability to generate a special [fsm.Traverser](https://github.com/fsm/fsm/blob/master/fsm.go#L36-L47) that provides some additional functionality that will help you with testing a bot.

Usage for Test is best described through concrete example, so check out the [fsm/getting-started test file](https://github.com/fsm/getting-started/blob/master/bot_test.go).
